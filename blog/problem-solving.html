    <h1>When I was blocked on a simple problem</h1>
    <p>
      When I was on the manipulating objects task, I was blocked on step 4,
      which is "add a key to an object and assign it a value." When I finished
      coding this step, I found that I couldn’t get the correct answer back.
      Instead of getting an object back, I only got a string back. I found out
      about this problem by using console.log. At first, I couldn’t figure out
      why and got a bit frustrated. I had to tell myself to just relax and
      decided to take my dogs out for a walk. While I was walking my dogs, I
      suddenly realised that instead of assigning it a value, I assigned it a
      string.
    </p>
    <p>
      What I learned from this is that I need to read the question properly and
      really understand what it wants me to do. It said assign the VALUE, not
      the STRING.
    </p>

    <h1>The time I elegantly solved a problem</h1>
    <p>
      The concatMyArray from the building methods task was a pretty
      straightforward and relatively easy one for me. I did a google search,
      learned the syntax of .join() and solved this task. I used console.log to
      check the result. I felt pretty happy when I got it right and it didn’t
      take me long to solve.
    </p>
    <p>
      What I learned is that you can always check the syntax or examples of
      different methods online (from W3Schools, MDN, or anywhere really!) If you
      can’t remember how to use it or even don’t know how to use it, they give
      you clear description, syntax and good examples.
    </p>

    <h1>
      How confident you feel using each of these problem-solving
      techniques/processes
    </h1>
    <h2>Pseudocode</h2>
    <p>
      This is the one I need to practice more. Instead of writing all the steps
      down, I tend to do this all in my head. I need to practice writing
      Pseudocode down before trying to write the code.
    </p>
    <h2>Trying something</h2>
    <p>
      I am pretty confident about trying something different. I guess that’s how
      I can get my code working.
    </p>
    <h2>Rubber ducky method</h2>
    <p>
      I haven’t used this method yet. It still all pretty much happened in my
      head. I had a cry baby figure and it sits on my table now. I might try to
      talk to her when I'm stuck.
    </p>
    <h2>Reading error messages</h2>
    <p>
      This can be quite useful. I can’t say I am super confident with this one,
      but when I do get error messages, I know what the test were expecting and
      what it actually received from me, which allows me to know where my
      problem is.
    </p>
    <h2>console.logging</h2>
    <p>
      I use console.log to check my code a lot. I've found it is really useful.
      It told me what type of error I made. Sometimes the syntax was wrong, then
      I know I need to fix my syntax, I probably used a comma instead of a
      semicolon.
    </p>
    <h2>Googling</h2>
    <p>
      I use Google a lot. Especially with the methods that I don’t know or don’t
      know how to use.
    </p>
    <h2>Asking your peers for help</h2>
    <p>
      I asked help from one of my peers when I was stuck on one of the
      challenges. I couldn’t figure out my problem for ages. It is just crazy
      that other people can just spot it straightaway!
    </p>
    <h2>Asking coaches for help</h2>
    <p>
      I've only done this once and John helped me with my question and it is
      helpful. I'm not super confident with this but I need to work on it.
    </p>
    <h2>Improving your process with reflection</h2>
    <p>
      I need to work on this more. Once I solve a challenge, I kind of just
      forget about it. I have to work hard on retaining what I’ve learned.
    </p>
    <h2>What made me relectant to ask for help</h2>
    <p>
      There were times that I needed help but was reluctant to ask. With some
      tasks, I just felt that if I just tried a bit harder, search a bit more,
      then I probably can get it right on my own. At other times, I was just so
      in the problem-solving zone, I actually forgot to think about asking for
      help.
