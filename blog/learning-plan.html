    <h1>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h1>
    <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
    <p>
      I am hoping that after finishing study with Dev Academy, I can work as a
      front end developer. I want to create fun and interactive websites and
      bring joy to people who are going to use them.
    </p>
    <h2>
      What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
      Bootcamp?
    </h2>
    <p>
      I still feel the same about my strengths and limitations. Being
      disciplined will definitely help me with the structured nature of
      Bootcamp. Sometimes when I’m nervous I can “speak nonsense” when trying to
      explain my ideas. I think Bootcamp will help me with this, though, because
      it’s so fast-paced that there’s no time to feel nervous. Just gotta get to
      it!!
    </p>
    <h2>
      What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will
      be?
    </h2>
    <p>
      I think my biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be speaking
      and expressing my ideas and thoughts well in front of a group of people. I
      can get nervous by just talking to one person. Imagine a group of people!!
      Teamwork and pairing with others are the two of the biggest challenges for
      me.
    </p>
    <h2>
      What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed
      in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h2>
    <p>
      For me, teamwork within groups, pairing with others are the two big things
      that I want to see develop in myself. I can get really nervous when I need
      to work with other people or a group of people. When my brain is
      preoccupied with the nervousness, it can slow down my thinking process and
      distract me from being focused.
    </p>
    <h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
    <p>
      Be availabel to help when/if I need it. Patience if I have trouble
      expressing myself when asking for help. encouragement when it gets hard.
    </p>
    <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
    <p>
      I will try my best to find solutions, but if I can’t I will reach out
      earlier, as I know the pace of Bootcamp will be significantly faster. I
      will set aside time at different parts of the day to make sure I can get
      my work done. I will reach out to my team members each day to make sure
      we’re all on the same page and achieving the tasks together.

      <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
      <p>
        My long term goal is prepare myself to become a front end developer.

      <h2>
        Description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.
      </h2>
      <h3>strengths</h3>
      <p>
        I am a pretty disciplined person, and I like routine. So If I know I
        have to do something, I will probably do it everyday. I tend to want to
        know as much as possible about a subject while learning it, which makes
        my learning a wider experience.
      </p>
      <h3>limitations</h3>
      <p>
        When it comes to learning, sometimes it can be challenging. When that
        happens, I tend to have lots of self doubt. When I have no confidence in
        myself, I notice that it becomes quite hard for me to focus. I have to
        be mindful when this happens.
      </p>

      <h2>
        What skills (non-technical core/ human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I am an introverted person, which means I am comfortable with doing
        thing indenpendantly. But I know as a developer, you have to
        communnicate with designers a lot in order to fully understand what the
        designers want. I want to see myself getting better with communicating
        and cooprating with other people.

      <h2>
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I will break down the sprint goals into smaller tasks and try to check
        them off day by day.
      </p>

    <div>
      <h2>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I will seek help by reaching on Discord when I run into an obstacle I
        can't solve on my own. If I can't solve it in 20 minutes I will reach
        out. This is a hard thing for me to do but I will try my best.
      </p>

      <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</h2>
      <p>
        I guess what I expect form the facilitators is that they will just be
        there for us. When we have questions or things that we don’t fully
        understand, just help us go through them all.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I am usually free during school hours, which is between 9:30 to 2:30. I
        won’t have much time available after school, cause I need to take my
        kids to go different after school activities.
