      <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
      <p>
        My long term goal is prepare myself to become a front end developer.

      <h2>
        Description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.
      </h2>
      <h3>strengths</h3>
      <p>
        I am a pretty disciplined person, and I like routine. So If I know I
        have to do something, I will probably do it everyday. I tend to want to
        know as much as possible about a subject while learning it, which makes
        my learning a wider experience.
      </p>
      <h3>limitations</h3>
      <p>
        When it comes to learning, sometimes it can be challenging. When that
        happens, I tend to have lots of self doubt. When I have no confidence in
        myself, I notice that it becomes quite hard for me to focus. I have to
        be mindful when this happens.
      </p>

    <div>
      <h2>
        What skills (non-technical core/ human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I am an introverted person, which means I am comfortable with doing
        thing indenpendantly. But I know as a developer, you have to
        communnicate with designers a lot in order to fully understand what the
        designers want. I want to see myself getting better with communicating
        and cooprating with other people.

      <h2>
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I will break down the sprint goals into smaller tasks and try to check
        them off day by day.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I will seek help by reaching on Discord when I run into an obstacle I
        can't solve on my own. If I can't solve it in 20 minutes I will reach
        out. This is a hard thing for me to do but I will try my best.
      </p>

      <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</h2>
      <p>
        I guess what I expect form the facilitators is that they will just be
        there for us. When we have questions or things that we don’t fully
        understand, just help us go through them all.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I am usually free during school hours, which is between 9:30 to 2:30. I
        won’t have much time available after school, cause I need to take my
        kids to go different after school activities.
