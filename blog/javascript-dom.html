        An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS
      </h1>
      <p>
        HTML, CSS and JavaScript are three essential technologies used in web
        development to create and style web pages. While they are separate
        technologies, but they work closely together to define the structure,
        content, appearances, functionality and interactivity of a webpage. HTML
        is like an architect, who plans, designs and oversees the construction
        of buildings. CSS is the interior designer, who will make indoor spaces
        functional, safe and beautiful by determining space requirements and
        selecting essential and decorative items – such as colours, lighting and
        materials. JavaScript is the homeowner who brings life and functionality
        to the house.

        Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday
        life

        </div>
        <h2>Explanation</h2>
        <p>
          I am using making hot Milo for the whole family as an example. Control
          flow determines the sequence of actions or decisions based on certain
          conditions. In my example, I need to follow all the steps from left to
          right in order to make the hot drink.
        </p>
        <p>
          A loop is a repetitive structure that allows us to perfrom the same
          set of instrctions multiple times. In my example, I have to make 5
          cups of Milo for the whole family. I can use loops to make the desired
          amount.

        Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with
        it
      </h1>
      <h2>What is DOM</h2>
      <p>
        The DOM, or Document Object Model, is structured representation of HTML
        documents. When the browser loads a web page, it creates a model of the
        page in memory.The browser structure this model using a DOM tree. The
        DOM is called an object model because the model(the DOM tree) is made of
        objects.
      </p>
      <h2>How to interact with it</h2>
      <p>
        The DOM allows JavaScript to access HTML elements and styles to
        manipulate them, which includes change text, HTML attributes and even
        CSS styles.
      </p>
      <div>
        <img
          src="/images/DOM manipulation example.png"
          alt="DOM manipulation example"
        />
      </div>
      <h2>Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        In this example, we first have to give the button element a id, which is
        ‘button’. Then we use the ‘getElementById’ method to retrieve the
        ‘button’ element. We then can use innerHTML property to amend the
        contents of this element.
      </p>
      <h1>
        Explain the difference between accessing date from arrays and objects
      </h1>
      <p>
        In JavaScript, arrays and objects are both used to store and organise
        data, but they have different characteristics and ways of accessing
        their data.
      </p>
      <h2>Arrays</h2>
      <p>
        An array is an ordered collection of elements. The elements in an array
        are indexed starting from zero. You can access array elements using
        their index value.
      </p>
      <div>
        <img src="/images/arrays example.png" alt="array example" />
      </div>
      <h2>Objects</h2>
      <p>
        An objects is an unordered collection of Key-value pairs.Unlike arrays,
        objects don’t have an inherent order for their properties. You can
        access objects properties using their keys.
      </p>
      <div>
        <img src="/images/objects example.png" height="alt="object example" />
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h1>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful</h1>
      <h2>what are functions?</h2>
      <p>
        In the most simple form, a function is simply a piece of code that we
        can reuse over and over again in our code.
      </p>
      <h2>Why they are helpful?</h2>
      <p>
        Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
        specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you
        can reuse the function, which enhance code reusability. They provide a
        structured approach to solving complex problems, making your code more
        efficient and easier to work with.
