      <h1>The difference between EQ and IQ?</h1>
      <p>
        Intelligence Quotient (IQ) is a measure of a person's cognitive
        abilities allowing one to acquire knowledge, learn and solve problems
        while Emotional Quotient (EQ),on the other hand, measures one's ability
        to monitor emotions, cope with pressures and demands and control one's
        thoughts and actions.

      <p>
        EQ helps individuals to manage disruptive emotions and impulses. It
        helps people to maintain standards of honesty and integrity. It enables
        people to take responsibility for personal performance and increase
        their flexibility in handling change.

      <p>
        People who have higher EQ can have a better understanding of other
        people’s feelings and perspective, and they take an active interest in
        their concerns. They can sense what others need in order to develop, and
        bolster their abilities.

        who has a high EQ can understand and manage their own emotions, which
        helps them make rational decisions, motivate their team members and
        inspire others. They can create an environment of trust, empathy and
        cooperation within their organisations.
