      What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due
      to the core learning?
    </h1>
    <ul>
      <li>I have fixed mindset and I need to work on changing it.</li>
      <li>
        I have already been learning a lot like piano and watercolor painting,
        which is building neuroplasticity, but I just didn’t know.
      </li>
      <li>
        Before I thought IQ was most important, but now I realise how important
        EQ is – in the workplace EQ will help me to interact with others well,
        but will also help me regulate my emotions and keep me mentally strong.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>
      What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
      programming?
    </h1>
    <p>
      In programming, having a clear set of values helps developers make ethical
      choices, prioritize tasks, and create software that aligns with their
      principles. Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of
      others. It enables developers to create user-friendly experiences and
      collaborate effectively in teams. Self-awareness involves understanding
      one's own emotions, strengths, weaknesses. It helps developers recognise
      their limitations, seed continuous improvement, and manage their
      interactions with others. All of these apply to learning too.
    </p>
    <h1>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h1>
    <p>
      By doing the core learning, I realised that there are still things about
      myself that I acturally don't know or don't know that well.
    </p>
    <h1>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h1>
    <p>
      For me, the most challenging aspects of the core learning is to actually
      implement what I’ve learned into practice. I had a fixed mindset before I
      started the course, I don’t really like facing challenges, I only do
      things in my comfort zone. I like to challenge myself only when I feel
      comfortable with what I’m doing. The intensity of the course and the
      knowledge that we have to learn is high so my fixed mindset is constantly
      kicking in. I have to be really mindful of what I am thinking and readjust
      quickly.
    </p>
    <h1>
      Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
      focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
    </h1>
    <p>
      Because web development is not solely about technical skills. It also
      involves effective communication, collaboration and problem-solving with
      clients and team members. All these aspects require us to really know
      ourselves and develop better human skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      By learning neuroplasticity and growth mindset, the knowledge that we’ve
      gained can motivate us to persist in our learning journey and help us
      overcome challenges and difficulties. A growth mindset is the belief that
      abilities and intelligence can be developed through dedication, effort,
      and learning from mistakes. By learning this, we will be able to face
      challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, and view failures as
      opportunities for growth.
    </p>
    <h1>
      Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
      time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead?
      Justify your answer.
    </h1>
    <p>
      Personally, I don’t think studying core learning is a waste of time. Using
      the time to practise coding is important – after all, that is the skill we
      want to gain in order to become a software developer – but core learning
      can help us explore ourselves more and understand ourselves better. For
      me, by learning neuroplasticity and growth mindset made me realise that
      our IQ isn’t innate, and it actually can develop. That helps when I face
      challenges and difficulties. Instead of having self-doubt and just claim
      that I am just not smart enough to this, I can tell myself that everything
      is new and I am still learning. It takes trial and error to get it right
      but I can do it in the end. I think overall it will help us to become more
      well-rounded developers.
