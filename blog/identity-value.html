        When I worked in Beijing, I remembered that one time I got overpaid from
        work by quite a lot. I decided to tell them about it. They were grateful
        as they didn’t even realise how much they overpaid me. For me, I think
        being honest is crusial. I have to be honest with things in order to
        build trust with the company. It was just the right thing to do whether
        there is any benefit later or not. The amount of money that I got
        overpaid might be nothing to the company, but if I haven’t returned it,
        basically the trust would be gone. Now I think about it and I still
        believe it is the right thing to do. The company might never find out
        about that or they might. But for me, being honest that leaves me no
        regrets.

      <h2>
        Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your

      <h3>Cultural upbringing</h3>
      <p>
        I grew up in China and attended formal education all the way to
        University. The educational system in China is extremely competitive. If
        you’re not the best student in the class then some of the teachers don't
        give you much attention, and also you need pretty good grades to be able
        to get in to high school. Because of this, I had to work really hard to
        get good grades in order to get accept by high school then be able to go
        to university. This influenced me to work very hard and be extremely
        self disciplined in order to achieve my goal. Even in difficult
        situations, I have to tell myself to keep pushing and never give up.
      </p>
      <h3>People in my life</h3>
      <p>
        I have to say that the person who has influenced me tremendously is my
        granddad. He is the kindest person that I have known. He showed me so
        much love and care, and that really shaped me who I am as a person.

      <h2>
        Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
        learning journey.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Because of the intense nature of the educational system in China, hard
        work and self-regulation is ingrained into how I study. I am a pretty
        disciplined person, and I like routine. So If I know I have to do
        something, I will probably do it everyday. I tend to want to know as
        much as possible about a subject while learning it, which makes my
        learning a wider experience.

      <h2>
        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Language – because English is my second language, there will always be
        times where I don’t understand what someone said or even meant.
        Sometimes instructions might take me a bit longer to fully understand. I
        know this will get better with time and experience, but it’s definitely
        a limitation to work through.
      </p>
      <p>
        Self-confidence – I need to build more self-confidence. This is
        definitely one of my limitations, which brings me self doubt. It will
        lessen my efficiency in terms of learning.

        others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
        tired at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what
        other strategies you would try now and why.

        When I first started at a job in Beijing, all my manager did was tell me
        to "read the website" for 2 weeks to “get to know the company.” Within a
        few days I’d already done it then they wouldn’t give me anything else to
        do. As a side note, the workplace in China, much like school, can be
        very competitive and people worry about losing their job. I wanted to
        start actually doing meaningful work, but they kept sending me back to
        look at the website… again!! To deal with this, I insisted on being
        given some real work and eventually they gave me something useful to do.
        I used the strategy of persistence and showing that I'm not going to
        give up, that I’m ready.
