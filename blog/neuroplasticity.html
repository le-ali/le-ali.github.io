    <h1>Intro</h1>
    <p>
      People who have never heard of growth mindset probably imagine that
      everyone's intelligence is fixed. We are either born smart, dumb, or
      average, and our ability to learn is pre-determined. We don't question
      this, and somehow, we've been led to believe that after a certain point
      we're either smart or not and that is the end of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can still remember clearly that when I was at school sometimes I could
      hear the teacher say that this person or that person is pretty clever kid.
      When a “not so clever” kid went up front to ask a question, the teacher
      had no smile on her face. When the clever one went up front to ask a
      question, she showed the opposite. This affected me a lot. For the whole
      time, I truly believed that we are born smart, dumb or just average.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth is that intelligence can be developed, just as any physical
      ability can be developed. It requires work and can be difficult, but it is
      achievable. Now that I think about it, the problem is not the child who
      “isn’t clever,” but the teacher that fails to see the child’s intelligence
      and talents. Their judgments are often based on the tests or assessments
      that do not consider individual character, health, environmental
      conditions, and most importantly, neuroplasticity!
    </p>
    <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
    <p>
      Neuroplasticity, also known as neural plasticity or brain plasticity, is
      the brain’s ability to reorganise and restructure itself on a cellular
      level. Our brain is full of cells called neurons. At one end of each
      neuron there are branches called dendrites. The spots where one neuron’s
      dendrites touch the neighbouring neuron are called synapses. When we
      learn, the number and strength of then synapses grow. When something is
      difficult and challenging, putting in added effort builds more dendrites!
    </p>
    <p>
      Understanding this can bring several benefits to people in different
      aspects of their lives. It can help people approach learning with a growth
      mindset. It plays a crucial role in the recovery process after brain
      injuries or strokes. Understanding these principles can empower
      individuals to take an active role in their rehabilitation. Recognising
      the brain’s plasticity can have a positive impact on mental health. It
      tells us that our brain is not fixed and can change. We can learn to form
      a new way of thinking in order to improve our mental health.
    </p>
    <h2>There are several ways to increase my neuroplasticity:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Doing the course with DevAcademy has a significant impact on promoting
        neuroplasticity. I am learning new things and facing challenges
        everyday!
      </li>
      <li>
        Expanding my English vocabulary or getting better in English in general.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using my non-dominant hand – I am an ambidextrous and already practice
        that everyday in my life.
      </li>
      <li>Creating artwork – I love painting, especially with watercolour!</li>
      <li>Reading</li>
      <li>Playing piano – it is therapy for me!</li>
      <li>Doing mindfulness meditation</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Growth mindset</h1>
    <p>
      Growth mindset is based on the belief that your basic qualities are things
      you can cultivate through your efforts. People with a growth mindset
      believe that we all have the capacity to learn and grow our skills.
      Failure is just a valuable lesson, and it is not the grand finale. People
      who are good at something are so because they built that ability, and we
      are all in control of our own abilities. I think it is such an important
      thing to know, because it does change the way we think. It helps us to be
      more positive towards learning, facing challenges, difficulties and even
      failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am so glad that I discovered it. I always believed that people’s
      intelligence and talents have a ceiling. We are born smart, dumb or just
      average. I find that the people around me further reinforce my existing
      beliefs, making me believe this even more strongly. Because of that, up
      until now I have pretty much done everything based on a fixed mindset.
      Learning that we should have a growth mindset instead of a fixed mindset
      has given me hope, because I now know my skills, talents and intelligence
      are not set in stone. We all have the ability to change.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will take time for me to adjust my thinking patterns, but I will work
      to incorporate a growth mindset into my daily life. I have to learn to
      embrace challenges and truly believe that with effort, I can master
      whatever that I am doing. Failures are just an opportunity to learn and
      grow.
    </p>

    <h1>How can neuroplacticity and a growth mindset influence my learning?</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Remind myself that while I’m learning, neruoplasticity is working. So
        it’s actually working.
      </li>
      <li>
        Instead of dwelling on the negatives in myself and focussing on the
        difficulties of the challenges, see opportunities in every situation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Believe that it doesn’t matter if the steps are big or small, each step
        is leading me to achieving my goal.
      </li>
    </ul>
